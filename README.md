# Small-World-Phenomenon-(based on Dijkstra Algorithm)
The small-world phenomenon is the principle that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances. 
The pioneering work of Stanley Milgram in the 1960's was among the first to make the phenomenon quantitative, allowing people to speak of the six degrees of
separation between any two people in the United States. Since then, a number of network models have been proposed as frameworks in which to study the problem 
analytically. One of the most refined of these models was formulated in recent work of Watts and Strogatz; their framework provided compelling evidence that 
the small-world phenomenon is pervasive in a range of networks arising in nature and technology, and a fundamental ingredient in the evolution of the World Wide Web.
